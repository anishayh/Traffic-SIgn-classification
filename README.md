# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Traffic Sign Classification with Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify traffic signs from images. The model is trained on a dataset containing various types of traffic signs commonly encountered on roads.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled images of traffic signs. It includes a variety of traffic signs such as stop signs, yield signs, speed limit signs, pedestrian crossing signs, etc. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

Model Architecture
The model architecture employed for this task is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images effectively. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the images. The final layers include fully connected layers to map these features to the appropriate classes.

Implementation
The implementation is done using Python programming language along with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These libraries provide high-level APIs for building and training neural networks efficiently.

Training
The model is trained on the training dataset using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer to minimize the classification error. During training, data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, scaling, and flipping are applied to increase the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization ability. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to quantify the model's performance.
